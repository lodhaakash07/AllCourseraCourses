**Question 1**  
What is the goal of A/B testing?  
- To compare the performance two (or more) interface variations **ANS**  
- To test users' answers to quiz questions  
- To create software and release it in version A, refine and release version B, and so on  
- To allow users to choose interface options from a menu   

**Question 2**  
What is a heuristic evaluation?  
- Having users test a system with low-tech paper prototypes  
- Developing a description of an example user and thinking about how he or she might use the system  
- Analyzing a system according to a set of guidelines for good usability. **ANS**  
- Presenting a description of a system of a group of representative users  

**Question 3**  
What is the goal of a usability study?  
- To test the security of a system  
- To develop new measures of usability  
- To study the theoretical aspects of usability  
- To measure and describe usability of a system for given tasks**ANS**  

**Question 4**  
If we ran an experiment to test if password logins were faster than a voice recognition authentication system, what would be required to show passwords were faster?  
- The users of the password group reported higher satisfaction on surveys than the voice recognition group  
- Password users remembered their passwords more easily than voice recognition users remembered how to authenticate  
- Statistical tests showed that the password group logged in significantly faster than the voice-recognition group.**ANS**  
- The average login time for password users was lower than for voice recognition users  

**Question 5**  
Which of the following is not something you would do when running a controlled experiment to evaluate an interface?  
- Select average users to test the control interface and expert users to test the experimental interface.  
- Have some people try using the control interface while other people try using the experimental interface  
- Have each person in the experiment try both interfaces.**ANS**  
- Provide users with training and instructions on how to use the control and experimental interfaces  

**Question 6**  
Qualitative evaluation is intended to:  
- Measure how well a user remembers the steps required to complete a task  
- Understand user experiences and reactions to a design**AnS**  
- Count the number of errors a user makes when using the system  
- Time how long it takes a user to complete a task  

**Question 7**  
Which of the following is NOT a standard observation method  
- Constructive Interaction  
- Think Aloud  
- Assisted Use **ans**  
- Silent Observer  

**Question 8**  
Why do we conduct usability studies on systems that have already been designed?  
- Users often make ignorant mistakes. A usability study will show areas in which us ers need better training.  
- Despite their best efforts, designer and developers cannot know exactly how users will interact with their system. A usability study will find previously uncovered errors.*ANS**   
- A usability study will show how much users like a system and that can help companies set the price for their software  

**Question 9**  
- Which of the following are typical questions to ask on a pre-test questionnaire?  
- What is your highest level of education **ans**  
- What is your age **ans**  
- What was most challenging about using the interface  
- How difficult was it to complete task 1  

**Question 10**  
When conducting a controlled experiment, which of the following is not part of the process  
- Design and test the experimental protocol  
- State a lucid hypothesis  
- Explain to participants what conclusions you hope to draw from the results**ANS**  
- Identify dependent and independent variables
