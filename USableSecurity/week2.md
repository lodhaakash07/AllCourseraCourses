##Week 2

**Question 1**  
What is the cycle of the iterative design process?  
- Design - Analysis - Coding - Testing  
- Requirements - Development - Release  
- Design - Analysis - Testing - Refinement  
- Requirements - Design - Development - Testing **ANS**  

**Question 2**  
What's the difference between system centered design and user centered design  
- System centered design is focused on what is easy to build on a platform while user centered design is focused on user  needs and context. **ANS**   
- System centered design is about analyzing systems but user centered design is about analyzing users  
- System centered design focuses on developing systems while user-centered sign focuses on developing user tasks.
  
**Question 3**  
Which of the following are NOT good ways to incorporate user-centered design in the design of security systems?  
- Designing security based on the user's environment and work context  
- Designing security around user tasks  
- Designing security based on what experts believe is best. **ANS**  

**Question 4**  
When designing error messages, which are important factors to keep in mind for usability?  
- Use language that users will understand **ANS**  
- Make the most secure options part of the user's natural task **ANS**  
- Provide users with clear exits to get out of a security warning **ANS**  
- Use technical terms to fully explain the message to users  
- Force users to approve security exceptions  

**Question 5**  
If you were designing security for the entrance to a secure facility, which of the following should you consider?  
- What programming libraries are easy to use and freely available  
- How often users enter and exit **ANS**  
- What tasks the users are in the middle of when they need to access the area.**ANS**  
- Which algorithms are most efficient  

**Question 6**  
Which of the following are disadvantages of personas?  
- They make potential users too "real" for designers  
- They are expensive and time-consuming to create   
- A diverse audience may be difficult to represent with a normal-sized set of personas **ANS**  
- Too many personas can be difficult to create and manage. **ANS**  
- All team members work with a consistent model of users  

**Question 7**  
Which of these are advantages of low-fidelity (e.g. paper) prototypes  
- They let designers see the impact of font size, color, and other visual elements  
- They can be created quickly and cheaply **ANS**  
- They can be used to calculate how long it will take users to accomplish certain tasks  
- Any team member can create one, regardless of programming skills **ANS**  

**Question 8**  
Which of the following are present in good interface design?  
- Encryption of all data transmitted on a network  
- Relies on common interaction techniques for familiarity **ANS**  
- Minimal training needed for a person to use the system **ANS**  
- Easy to recover from errors **ANS**  

**Question 9**  
Which of the following is NOT an important part of the design process  
- Consider usability guidelines  
- Prepare a prototype  
- Solicit user input  
- Compute the efficiency of the underlying algorithms **ANS**  

**Question 10**  
In participatory design and co-design, which of the following is true  
- Designers brainstorm and create prototypes after asking potential users questions  
- Average users have equal standing with designers **ANS**  
- Users design the system on their own based on a list of constraints provided by designers  
- Managers convey input from users to designers
